this is so unorganized lol but uhh if you're reading this then hi

if you're expecting to learn much from looking at this repo i don't really think this will help because this is mostly just for my personal projects / experimenting with learning C

but if you're just interested (for some reason) then hi (i don't think i'm going to put this on any portfolios or anything lol)

fundamentals folder has some of the basic ideas of how C works, small little tests of features
projects folder has more "fun" stuff

p.s. if you see an account like "voxel" or whatever in some of the commit messages that's my personal account that i forgot to remove authentication in vscode for, so it automatically commits for me using that account. oops

bye!
